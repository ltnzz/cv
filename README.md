## Assets / Images

All images used in this project are stored in the `assets` folder.  
To replace any default image, follow these steps:

1. Add your new image to the `assets` folder.
2. Make sure the file name matches the image you want to replace, or update the reference in your HTML/CSS/JS accordingly.
3. Check the image size to ensure it fits well in the website layout.

> **Note:** The `assets` folder is ignored by Git, so make sure anyone running the project adds the required images to this folder.
